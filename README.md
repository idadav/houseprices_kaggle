# houseprices_kaggle
As a part of my Master, we had to complete the House Prices kaggle competition, using only smart feature engineering with lasso or ridge regression. 

My code is mainly dealing with NA's and the many features. Finally I attempt Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net (mix of the two) and some simple model stacking.
